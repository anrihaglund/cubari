Just when it seems like life can't get any worse, she's now being sold at a slave auction! When a cloaked man, with the head of a beast' skull and wielding strange powers, purchases her, Chise’s life will never be the same again.\n\nThe man is a a sorcerer of great power, a kindly magus who frees Chise and then makes a bold statement: Chise will become his apprentice–and his bride!\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",
